							<h6>Problem</h6>

								The Chief Operating Officer of Tecademics, Daniel Silver wanted to build a platform where his company operations could be managed efficiently. This entailed automating processes like sales funnel, incubation, along with course and transaction management.

He also wanted to enable affiliate product marketing for various Tecademics products. All of this was to be accomplished within one month’s time so the project was time bound. Daniel asked around to find some suitable software development  companies or freelancers who could help him with this platform.
