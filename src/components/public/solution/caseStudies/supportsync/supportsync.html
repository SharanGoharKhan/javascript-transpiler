							<h6>Problem</h6>
							<p>
								Support Sync launched a returns services company called Brandlink Resources, and handled returns for one of America's fastest growing companies. Realizing that the returns are an inevitable reality in almost every company, the CTO of Support Sync, Jeff Kolyer looked for a software development company to create an application for other companies to display their outstanding services. He had already created designs for the app but required support in implementation. His ultimate need was to get a returns management system that synchronized customers, support agents and return center personnel in real-time. Jeff tried to get some suitable software development  companies or freelancers who could help him with this application.

							<h6>Solution</h6>
							<p>
								Jeff searched and went through various directories of software development companies but none seemed to be a cost effective and affordable option for him. He heard of HireNinja through his network as an affordable software company that delivered  reliably and efficiently. Around 3 Coding Ninjas got to work and developed an end to end Return Merchandise Authorization solution for Support Sync to help companies communicate in tracking, prioritizing, and coordinating.

							<h6>Results</h6>
							<p>
								Support Syncâ€™s software solution for RMA proved beneficial for not only Support Sync but also for thousands of client companies including Nabi, Payrange, Night Owl, Pivot Head and many more. Companies like Nabi can now manage thousands of returns every week in real-time owing to the software developed by HireNinja for Support Sync.
