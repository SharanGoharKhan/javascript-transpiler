							<h6>Problem</h6>
							<p>
								Probist used to be a platform where users could sync all their YouTube channel videos onto their Facebook and Twitter page. The COO of Probist, Altamash Janjua had a bigger vision for the company. Altamash wanted video website creation to be easy as possible for any user who signed up at Probist. He envisioned a platform that allowed users to create a website with just 1 mouse click and sync all YouTube channel videos with the website's video section. There was a list of ad-on features like theme selection and custom domains which Altamash wanted to be incorporated into the platform however he just couldn't find the right team to develop it, since all his own resources were working on other products.

							<h6>Solution</h6>
							<p>
								Altamash floated his idea and requirements within his circle and HireNinja was referred as the best development team by one of his colleagues, since they had worked on a similar project very recently. Altamash proceeded to view HireNinjaâ€™s recent work and instantly sent over the project for development. HireNinja assigned 2 of its pre-screened Coding Ninjas for Probist and listed JavaScript, AngularJS, PHP, Laravel, HTML, CSS3, Bootstrap, and YouTube API and other tech to be used in project to make the platform fast and efficient. The platform was effectively developed within 3 weeks with impeccable code quality.

						</ul>

							<h6>Results</h6>
							<p>
								As a result of the efforts put in by Coding Ninjas Probist has now become a huge deal in the industry. Famous brands like Google, Pepsi and Coca Cola use Probist and love the results. The platform receives over 2.5 million hits everyday.
