							<h6>Problem</h6>
							<p>
								With Euro 2012 around the corner, the COO of Eyeka was looking for a software development company that could do a software job for them in the shortest time possible. The project entailed developing a Hyundai Euro 2012 video contest for football fans through a Facebook application.  The goal of the app was to promote the Hyundai brand through 45 second video testimonials of passionate football fans from around the world. Furthermore people could vote for videos which would help decide the contest winner. However the challenge was to get the project done within a few days therefore the job was floated in the market with the promise to award the project to a company that would do it in the least time.
